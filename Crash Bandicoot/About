This project is about the recreation of the OG Crash Bandicoot gameplay. 
I developed this project using the Unity software that allowed me to 
create 3D objects and assign C# scripts to them for controlling their behavior to 
make the overall gameplay feel similar to the gameplay of the original Crash Bandicoot 
games. In my scripts I incorporated object oriented programming where each type of object is part
of a class.
