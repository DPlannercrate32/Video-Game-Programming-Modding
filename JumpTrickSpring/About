This is a personal project that modifies a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game to add abilities to Sonic's moveset. 
I leverage an API from a video game modder that allowed me to modify the game with C++ coding, basically 
giving me access to the game's memory so I can modify specific gameplay features. I wanted to simulate the gameplay
of a 2D Sonic game of a portable Nintendo device.
