This project was my attempt at recreating the gameplay of a 2D Sonic the Hedgehog game which was a speed based game.
I utilized the Unity software to create 3D objects and attach C# scripts to them to control their behaviors. I made an
objects to represent Sonic and the camera, and used C# coding to control his speed and movements, as well as code to
manage the camera, allowing it to track his position.
